# Usermode API library for a NI Maschine Mikro MK2

This is a learning/experimentation project for Rust.

Much of the protocl implementation details have been obtained from the cabl project.

The ultimate end goal is to move this project onto amicrocontroller (likely the Raspberry Pi Pico) to use the controller to either output MIDI or act as a CV source or sequencer.
